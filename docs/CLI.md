# Mycelial Command Line Interface (CLI)

The CLI application is designed to ease the process of setting up and using
Mycelial, the edge data movement platform. At it's core, the CLI application
enables users to download and configure a dual-component system, comprising both
a client and server. After downloading the client and server applications, the
CLI application provides a wizard like interface that walks the user through 
the client configuration process. After downloading and configuring the client,
the CLI can start both the client and server processes. Additionally, you can 
use the CLI application to install the client as a service.

## Installation


Install the Mycelial CLI for your system.

## Initialization

Run the following command to download and configure Mycelial.

To download both the client and the server, run the following command:

```sh
mycelial init --local
```

or to download just the client or the server, use the corresponding options:

```sh
mycelial init --client
# mycelial init --server
```

After downloading the binaries, you will be prompted with a series of
configuration questions. For demo purposes, you should accept the default values
when available.

Upon exiting, the `init` step will create a `config.toml` file, which will be
used by the Mycelial client (myceliald).

If you would like to name the client configuration file something other than the
default (`config.toml`), you can pass the `--config` flag with your desired file
name:

```sh
mycelial init --config my_config.toml
```

Note: if you use a custom config file name (ex. `my_config.toml`), you'll need
to pass the `--config` flag along with your custom config file name to
subsequent CLI commands.

## Starting

Run the following command to start the server and client.

```sh
mycelial start
```

Or, use the `--client` or `--server` options to start them individually.

If you wish to use a custom config file (ex. `my_config.toml`), you should pass
it to the start command like this: `mycelial start --config ./my_config.toml`

When prompted for a token, use the one you used in the `init` step.

After completing this step, you should be able to open the web interface 
`http://localhost:7777`.

## Shutdown

Run the following command to terminate the server and client.

```sh
mycelial destroy
```

Or, use the `--client` or `--server` options to terminate them individually.

## Reset

If you wish to reset the local environment (ie, delete the client and/or server 
SQLite databases), you can run the reset command:

```sh
mycelial reset
```

If you use the `--client` or `--server` options, the corresponding database will
be deleted.

If you setup the client with a custom config file (ex `my_config.toml`), you
will need to pass the file name with the `--config` flag.

## Adding new sources/destinations

If you've already configured the client (ie, created a `config.toml` file), you
can add additional sources and/or destinations by running the following command:

```sh
mycelial add --source 
# or mycelial add --destination
```

As with most other commands, you can specify a custom config file name (ex
`my_config.toml`) with the `--client <config_file_name>` flag.

After running this command, you'll be prompted with a series of questions that
will assist you in creating the new source/destination.

## Add client as a service

If you wish to run the client (Myceliald) as a background service, run the
following command:

```sh
sudo mycelial service add --client
```

This will download the latest release of the Mycelial client (Myceliald) and 
save it into `/usr/local/bin/myceliald`. Next, it will prompt you with a series
of questions, and upon exiting the command, it will save a configuration file to 
`/etc/mycelial/config.toml`. Lastly, the client (Myceliald) will be setup
as a service (systemd etc) and automatically started. 

The location of the client (Myceliald) SQLite database is
`/var/lib/mycelial/client.db`

If you already have a configuration file that you would like to use with the
client service, you can pass the `--config <config_file_name>` flag.

## Remove the client service

If you have previously installed the client (Myceliald) as a service, you can 
run the following command to remove the service:

```sh
sudo mycelial service remove --client
```

By default, the client configuration file `/etc/mycelial/config.toml` and the 
associated SQLite file `/var/lib/mycelial/client.db` will be left untouched. If
you wish to remove these files, you can pass the `--purge` option.

## Service subcommands

### Status

If you would like to check the status of the client (Myceliald) service, you
can run the following command:

```sh
sudo mycelial service status --client
```

### Stop

If you would like to stop the client (Mycelaild) service, you can run the
following command:

```sh
sudo mycelial service stop --client
```

### Start

If you have stopped the client (Myceliald) service and you would like to start
it you can run the following command:

```sh
sudo mycelial service start --client
```

### Restart

If you need to restart the client (Myceliald) service, you can run the following
command:

```sh
sudo mycelial service restart --client
```
